## Purpose
Originally, there was a problem with CityU students that there is no unified platform for them to come to for sharing updates. Facebook, Twitter & Instagram all feel a little bit more general for a school social sharing. Therefore, I'd thought it'd be cool to design and develop a fully functioning photo sharing platform for CityU, and ... that's the purpose!
