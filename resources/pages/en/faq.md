## Q1 - Why do I need a different account since I already have a CityU account?
### A1: Simply because CityU official didn't approve API authentication for the site to integrate with CityU account. So this site only allows users with @cityu.edu or @cityuniversity.edu email to sign up.

## Q2 - What are the differences between CityU Pics and Instagram?
